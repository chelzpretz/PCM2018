## Phylogenetics Comparative Methods README

This folder will contain all the information (reviews of reading and lab work) from PCM course taught by Andrew Hipp in Spring 2018. All resources will come from the [PCM-2018] (github.com/andrew-hipp/PCM-2018) github. 

This directory is created by [Chelsea Pretz](chelsea.pretz@colorado.edu).

### **Weekly Folders** will contain all the resource of that week's topic. Below is the list of labs with topics.


Week One - Trees, traits, and covariance  
Week Two - Independent contrasts and its extensions: addressiong phyologenetic autocorrection  
Week Three - Generalized linear models (GLS)  
Week Four - Fitting and evaluating alternative models  
Week Five - Stretching the tree: evolutionary rates and models of continours traint evolution  
Week Six - Ornstein-Uhlenback  
Week Seven - Multivariate vs univariate; and accounting for intraspecific variation and error  
Week Eight - Phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic methods in community ecology part I.  
Week Nine - Phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic methods in community ecology part II.  
Week Ten - Effects of traits on lineage diversification.  


### **Project** This folder will contain inspired projects for the material that will be covered in the course. This folder will be updated as the semester continues.
