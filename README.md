## Phylogenetics Comparative Methods README

This folder will contain all the information (reviews of reading and lab work) from PCM course taught by Andrew Hipp in Spring 2018. All resources will come from the [PCM-2018](github.com/andrew-hipp/PCM-2018) github. 

This directory is created by [Chelsea Pretz](chelsea.pretz@colorado.edu).

### **Weekly Folders** will contain all the resource of that week's topic. Below is the list of labs with topics.

Week One - Trees, traits, and covariance  
Week Two - Independent contrasts and its extensions: addressiong phyologenetic autocorrection  
Week Three - Generalized linear models (GLS)  
Week Four - Fitting and evaluating alternative models  
Week Five - Stretching the tree: evolutionary rates and models of continours trait evolution  
Week Six - Ornstein-Uhlenback   
Week Seven - Reversible and Irreversible Traits  
Week Eight - Phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic methods in community ecology.  
Week Nine -  Overview of PCM  

---> Didn't do -- Multivariate vs univariate; and accounting for intraspecific variation and error and Effects of traits on lineage diversification.

### **Project** This folder will contain inspired projects for the material that will be covered in the course. This folder will be updated as the semester continues. 

R-code:    
	GenomeSize_LifeStyleCode.R -- is all the code used in the final project  
	pic_pcmFunc.R -- this is Hipp's PIC function that I didn't end up using  

Data:  
	Data_Sheet1.csv -- was the first working data file with some information for Kew Bot Garden's c-value along with other data  
	Data_LF1.csv -- the filed used for anaylsis. This data is all from Kew Bot Garden c-value database  
	
Output files:  
	LifeForm_smoothprunedtree.tre -- is a pruned tree from Ng's work with the data from Kew  
	ResultTable.xlsx -- is a result table from the anova tests  
	
Summary:  
	PCMPresentation.pptx -- is a presentation of the final project.
