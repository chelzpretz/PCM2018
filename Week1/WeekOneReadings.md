Overview of the paper:  
This paper is a review of the different fields (population genetics, community ecology, and paleobiology) and how phylogentics are used in those fields. 
It starts with reviewing the difference between Phylogenetic Independent Contrast (PIC) and Phylogenetic Generalize Least Squares (PGLS).
These two different methods are on the different sides of the spectrum. PICs is a data transformation that compares the difference between traits, models drift, and 
is done by taking old data and creating new data working with continuous traits. PGLS is more flexible and can incorporated different models of evolution. The rest of the paper 
directly covers methods for phylogenetic comparisons for each field.

Overview of the paper:  
This paper is condensed from a chapter from the book and covers different methods of how to graph a tree. Some notable graphs included a gene tree and PCA.
