## Week Three Reading: Generalized least squares

PGLS -- is a method for continuous traits, that is more flexible than PIC.

This paper shows the PIC and PGLS are functionally identical. This paper covers the idea of extinct species and how incorporating that effects the outcome of the analysis.

This book chapter makes a comparison of PGLS and standard regression. It states that PGLS is important because it takes into consideration. It also covers the importance for reporting assumptions and results in publications.

PGLS is a method that compares two different traits on a tree. This is important to consider phylogenies when making comparisons across species. This chapter covers how to make 
covariance structures, and using them in analysis and interpreting them. This chapter ends with highlighting 
some of the misunderstandings of phylogenetic signal in a PGLS context and the how to interpreter uncertain
and unknowns of a phylogeny. 

Notes:

OLS (ordinary least squares) -- the residual difference between the slope
GLS (generalize least squares) -- a transformed residual from the mean
