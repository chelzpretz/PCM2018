## Week Five -- Stretching the tree: evolutionary rates and models of continuous trait evolution

* Blomberg, S., Garland, T. and Ives, A., 2003. Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral traits are more labile. Evolution, 57(4), p.717-745.

Phylogentic signal is important when determine the correlation of traits between species. This paper presents new methods to use continuous traits with PICS and PGLS. 
There used several approaches to solve this issue:
1. Randomization that allows the null hypothesis to test for no pattern of similarity among relatives. This test for Type I error. 
2. Derive a descriptive statistic, so this quantifies that amount of phylogenetic signal of the characters across the tree. 
3. Establish a biologically motivated branch-length transformations for stabilizing selection, and trait evolution.

This paper covers how to add different rates within a model. This is important if different linages are going through different selection regimes.

Pagle is foreshadowing an issue in the field that will be solved once there is more genetic data available. He creates the math needed to solve the transition between binary traits.

This is a review of PCM that covers branch lenghts, gls, pics, and more.
