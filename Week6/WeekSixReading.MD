## Week 6 Readings -- Effects of traits on lineage diversification.

This week covers the OU (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) model. OU models uses continuous trait that can randomly walk with a "pull" to the optimal value.

This paper covers how to test adaptive evolution using PCM. OU models is the most used process becuase it incorporates both selection and drift in the 
model, along with restraining the selective optima into the adaptive zone. This paper does simulations to show the effect that constrant on the selection 
regimes has along with the randomly drift has on the model.

This paper covers the increased number of papers that use OU models that used them, along with the math, when there is statistical power, and how different tree types effect are effected. 
Cooper then highlights the three limitations of the OU model:
1. Type 1 error is common when there with a small sample size.
	It seems like there needs to be a minimal sample size of 200 taxa. 
2. Likelihood ratio tests can unreliable.
	AIC is the same as likelihood ratio and can be faulty in complex models.
3. Measurement errors can increase Type 1 error.
	Not have accurate measures can also lead to more errors...

Hanson -- states to choose the model that makes sense rather than the best model
