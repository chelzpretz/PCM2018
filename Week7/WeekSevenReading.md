## Week Seven -- Reversible and Irreversible Traits

** Golderg, E.E., Igic, B. On Phyolgenetic Test of Irreversible Evolution. Evolution, 62(11):2727-2741.

As the "Dollo's law" states complex traits are less likely to be reproduced. This paper test this theory by constraining 
the ancestral states and come to the conclusion that many times the ancestral stats is inferred wrong. This is usually causes 
by two main causes of these errors. The first is incorrect assignment of roots state and the effect of character speciation and extinction on
character state. The paper ends with the importance of incorporating irreversibility with addition information to aid in analysis.

Not using the right models and considering if irreversibly traits are possible can biased the outcome of the diversification on a tree can occur. 
If there is a trait that is considered a evolutionary dead-end (a trait that is advantageous now but lead to extinction), but is not considered 
it can lead to is interpretation of a tree that has asymmetrical character changes. In the end Maddision agrues that its hard to tease out diversification
and character changes.
