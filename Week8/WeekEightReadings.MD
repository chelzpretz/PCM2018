Overview of this paper:
This paper cover the importance of taking phylogenetic in to consideration in ecological communities by using the large diversity of of oaks in North Central Florida. It talks about the 
how different traits and niches (habitats) can be conserved (clustering) or convergent (evenness) on a tree. Using these methods it can be shown that there are different niches in communities
that are filled by different species across the tree.

Overview of this book chapter: 
This paper goes into more details of phylogenetic community ecology. It discuss the four different classesof shape, evenness, dispersion and dissimilarity on a tree. Both of these methods echo 
the importance of including PCM when making community comparisons of traits among species.  

NOTES:
-> Do you expected traits to have a phylogenetic signal? The traits alone should be correlated, without a phylogeny. Think about red flower won't have signal, but thin xylem will have 
phylogeny signal (all are conifers which are drought resistant).
