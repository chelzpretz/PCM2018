** Week Two: Independent contrasts and its extensions: addressing phylogenetic autocorrelation  

This overall goes into details about the importance of phylogenetic autocorrelation and the debate that it is not important. The first paper (Felsenstein, 1985) covers details
of the mathematical importance of the phylogenetic autocorrelation and a general overview of the methods. The next set of papers are reviews of different groups commenting on the 
use of this method. Each paper as a short summary.

**The problem** with inferring trait relates in that there could be the confound phylogenetically. This means if there is a correctional with brain size and body size could that be because
of an evolutionary model or is it due to high correlation and selection on those traits. Some different methods could be 1.) is it due to rapid radiation, 2.) changes on the branch are 
independent; 3.) bivariate normal distribution where some traits are correlated,; 4.) a Brownian motion, correlated traits; or 5.) having two groups of highly related species. The tricky thing
 is that we would want to solve these problems in a nonparametric way but if we don't account for the possibility of the situations above we might be addressing it in parametric way. An
 example of this is if there are two groups closely related and you select multiple individuals from both you are really just selecting two species.  
**Previous approaches** used nested analysis of variance to account for the most variation possible between closely related species and then find the non independence. Some others 
looks for trend in other families (does bird color differ in the same way?). One issues that arose with this is the not all classifications are monophyltic. Another issue with this 
method is changes on the tree appear to happen coincidental. (if two taxa have the same trait it must of have happened at the lca). This will need up biasing the results.  
**Possible solution** is all about figuring out what the signal is verse the noise. The steps as I understand it... yike!  
You will have to scale the X variable into variance units. This is then scaled from 0 to 1 units of variance with a normal distribution... X will be independent of each other but not the contrast of Y. (you can still look at the correction between X and Y)

**Question:** Where did s^2x come from? I don't actually know what s is referring to... sample.. 

Some of the next steps would be adding confidence intervals, and taking different character changes into account. This paper ends with stating there are many issues that we dont
have a answer for yet and that many current methods are invalid.  


* Westoby M, Leishman M, Lord J. 1995b. Further Remarks on Phylogenetic Correction. Journal of Ecology 83: 727–729.

This paper overs the idea that many people were using phylogenetic connections (PC) to aid in model section. This is not way PC was created but to reduce errors within the data. 
Harvey argues that the issue is in interpretation of the results. In the end he argues that ecology and evolution should be viewed separately, and to priority phylogeny over ecology -- 
unless proven otherwise. 

* Harvey PH, Read AF, Nee S. 1995. Further remarks on the role of phylogeny in comparative ecology. Journal of Ecology 83: 733–734.  

Harvey makes direct comment to Westoby paper stating the importance and need for phylogenetic correction in ecologists work.

* Westoby M, Leishman MR, Lord JM. 1995a. On Misinterpreting the `Phylogenetic Correction’. Journal of Ecology 83: 531–534.

Westoby respond that phylogenetic correction is important but not in ever situation. He provide two different examples that didn't need PC.


* Harvey PH, Read AF, Nee S. 1995. Why ecologists need to be phylogenetically challenged. Journal of Ecology 83: 535–536.  

Harvey fallowed up PC is always important... that evolution is not in a ecology framework but that other way around. 


Notes:

Brownian motion could be because of genetic drift or highly variable selection regimes. (maybe look you BM with selection regimes later -- only in simulations) 
Phylogenetic inertia = phylogenetic signal 
	Think of inertia as a non-MC process. Thinking about throwing a baseball it not all about where its at now, but where it came from.
Review: long-branch attraction -- this can happens most with comparison data with data that is highly variable
